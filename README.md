Music-Match
=======

This repository contains my project commented to skip songs and set your favorites, then it uses the Spotify API to link your favorited songs to a list of recommendations

### Getting the base project set up
First clone the project in your desired location.
Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. After having Ionic all set up run `ionic serve` to launch the local server.
